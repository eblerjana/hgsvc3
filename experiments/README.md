# Pipelines used to generate PanGenie genotyping / phasing results

## Main pipelines:
* **genotyping**: full pipeline to produce genotypes for 1kGP cohort from MC graphs
* **phasing**: full pipeline to phase genotypes and produce consensus haplotypes for 1kGP cohort
* **evaluate-consensus-haplotypes**: full pipeline used to compute variant-based QV estimates for consensus haplotypes

## Preliminary experiments / internal analyses 
* **other-analyses**: scripts to produce supplementary figures comparing MC and PAV
* **PAV-merged-set-analysis**: pipeline used to evaluate PAV calls before and after SV merging
